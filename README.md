raplysaattori
=============

Raplysaattori (Finnish) / Raplyzer (English) is a software used to detect rhymes and compute their lengths from Finnish or English rap lyrics.

Usage:

python raplyzer.py

(Computes rhyme factor for each artist under 'lyrics_en' directory. See main() in raplyzer.py for other options.)

You need to have eSpeak (http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) installed, if you want to analyze English lyrics for which phonetic transcription isn't available. For the lyrics under directory lyrics_en, the transcription has been precomputed.
